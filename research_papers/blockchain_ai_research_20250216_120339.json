    "abstract":"Blockchain technology (BT), as another important innovation following cloud computing, big data, mobile Internet and other information technologies, uses distributed node consensus algorithms to verify, store and update data, showing the unique advantages of centralization, distrust, anonymity and data tamper resistance. Smart contracts are based on BT as the underlying support, achieving automatic execution of contracts and providing more efficient and secure solutions for various transactions. This article delves into the digital automatic execution and verification mechanism of property rights based on BT and smart contracts. Through this mechanism, property rights information can be digitized and securely stored on the blockchain, achieving real-time updates and multi-party sharing of information, thereby greatly improving the transparency and traceability of property rights transactions. The application of smart contracts further enhances the automatic execution of transactions, ensuring the automatic triggering of relevant operations when transaction conditions are met, and ensuring the legality and effectiveness of transactions through built-in verification mechanisms. The experimental results indicate that this mechanism not only improves the efficiency of property rights transactions, reduces transaction costs and risks, but also brings revolutionary innovation to the field of property rights transactions.",

    "abstract":"Decentralized autonomous organizations(DAOs) enabled by blockchain and smart contracts is regarded as an effective tool to solve corporate governance problems. It can minimize the contract risks, principal-agent dilemmas, and other issues in corporate governance. However, DAOs also face a variety of governance issues, such as internal governance issues and external governance issues caused by the technical attributes of blockchain and smart contracts. DAO is a typical complex system with the characteristics of both social and engineering complexity. It is difficult for existing governance theories to solve governance problems in DAOs. The parallel intelligence theory based on the artificial systems + computational experiments + parallel execution (ACP) method is a suitable research and practical approach to solve management and control problems for complex systems. Therefore, we propose a parallel governance framework for DAO based on the parallel intelligence theory and discuss its key research issues. Finally, we construct a parallel governance system for GnosisDAO, and conduct computational experiments on its voting mechanism. The results show the defects of GnosisDAO governance mechanism and we thus propose further research directions. We consider that parallel governance represents the future trend of DAO research and practice. This paper is aimed at stimulating further effort and providing helpful guidance and reference for future research works.",

    "abstract":"With the advancement of blockchain technology, and the proliferation of Internet of things (IoT)\u2010driven devices, the blockchain\u2010IoT applications is changing the perception and working infrastructure of smart networks. Blockchain supports decentralized architecture and provides secure management, authentication, and access to IoT systems by deploying smart contracts provided by Ethereum. The growing demand and expansion of blockchain\u2010IoT systems is generating large volume of sensitive data. Moreover, distributed denial\u2010of\u2010service (DDoS) attacks are the most challenging threats to smart contracts in blockchain\u2010IoT systems. The 2016 decentralized autonomous organization and 2017 parity wallet attacks exposed the critical fault\u2010lines among Ethereum smart contracts. Currently, there is no security mechanism available for smart contracts after its deployment in blockchain\u2010IoT systems. In order to address these challenges, first we use two artificial intelligence techniques, random forest (RF) and XGBoost that gives full autonomy in decision making capabilities in the proposed security framework. Second, for data load balancing and distributed file storage of IoT data, interplanetary file system is suggested. Finally, we are the first to propose a distributed framework based on fog computing to detect DDoS attacks in smart contracts. The performance of the detection system is evaluated using actual IoT dataset, namely, BoT\u2010IoT. The proposed system is evaluated in terms of accuracy (AC), detection rate (DR), and false alarm rate (FAR). The results confirms the superiority of the proposed framework over some of the recent state\u2010of\u2010art techniques in detecting rare attacks. The proposed framework has achieved DR up to 99.99% using RF by using 10 features of BoT\u2010IoT dataset.",

To ensure the secure and economic operation of power systems with high penetration of renewable energy, it is necessary to solve the problem of inefficient utilisation of demand\u2010side resources by the current electricity market mechanism. The metaverse, an emerging technology attracting widespread attention, is expected to efficiently solve this problem. The metaverse can be regarded as a virtual\u2010real interactive economic system built on advanced technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, extended reality, avatars, and decentralised autonomous organisations (DAO). This paper first briefly introduces the concept, architecture, technologies, and features of the metaverse. Then, a metaverse\u2010based DAO for energy systems is proposed and the corresponding business model is explored. The Energy DAO utilises algorithms and user consensus combined with smart contracts to solidify organisational operation rules. In this way, it organises users to directly participate in multiple types of electricity markets and carbon markets, as well as behavioural data production and transactions. Finally, an Energy DAO example for demand\u2010side sources demonstrates how the Energy DAO could solve the problems of information asymmetry, information opacity, and incentive incompatibility in electricity market mechanisms.",

The self-organization phenomenon in natural ecosystems, the Cyber Movement Organizations (CMOs) on the Internet, and the Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI), and so on, can all be regarded as its early manifestations. In recent years, the rapid development of blockchain technology has spawned the emergence of the so-called Decentralized Autonomous Organization [DAO, sometimes labeled as Decentralized Autonomous Corporation (DAC)], which is a new organization form that the management and operational rules are typically encoded on blockchain in the form of smart contracts, and can autonomously operate without centralized control or third-party intervention. DAO is expected to overturn the traditional hierarchical management model and significantly reduce organizations\u2019 costs on communication, management, and collaboration. However, DAO still faces many challenges, such as security and privacy issue, unclear legal status, and so on. In this article, we strive to present a systematic introduction of DAO, including its concept and characteristics, research framework, typical implementations, challenges, and future trends. Especially, a novel reference model for DAO which employs a five-layer architecture is proposed. This article is aimed at providing helpful guidance and reference for future research efforts.",

While smart contracts offer efficiency and security, their automation introduces significant legal challenges. Detecting and preventing fraud is a primary concern. This paper proposes a novel application of artificial intelligence (AI) to address these challenges. We will develop a machine learning model, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to effectively detect and mitigate fraudulent activities within smart contracts. The AI model will analyze both textual and transactional data from smart contracts to identify patterns indicative of fraud. This approach not only enhances the security of digital transactions on blockchain platforms but also informs the development of legal standards and regulatory frameworks necessary for governing these technologies. By training on a dataset of authentic and fraudulent contract examples, the proposed AI model is expected to offer high predictive accuracy, thereby supporting legal practitioners and regulators in real-time monitoring and enforcement. The ultimate goal of this project is to contribute to legal scholarship by providing a robust technological tool that aids in preventing cybercrimes associated with smart contracts, thereby laying a foundation for future legal research and development at the intersection of law, technology, and security.",

Especially with the implementation of the \"the Belt and Road\" strategy, this development trend is more obvious. This plan was launched by China in 2013 with the aim of promoting infrastructure construction, trade cooperation, cultural exchanges, common development, and regional cooperation in Asia, Europe, Africa, and other regions. With the rapid development of Internet, big data, artificial intelligence and other technologies, the digital economy has become an important driving force for the development of the world economy. It has not only changed the operation mode of traditional industries, but also spawned new industrial forms. However, in a network environment lacking trust, trustworthy communication of data is an important prerequisite for promoting active data sharing among network entities. Information security technology based on encryption technology can effectively solve problems such as data untrustworthiness and privacy leakage in information exchange. This paper focused on the trusted exchange of data in the \"the Belt and Road\" digital economic cooperation, and discussed how to solve the trust problem in data exchange with the help of blockchain smart contract technology. First, the background of the \"the Belt and Road\" initiative and the significance of digital economy development were briefly introduced. Subsequently, the challenges faced by trusted data exchange in a network environment lacking trust were analyzed, and a solution based on blockchain smart contracts was introduced. The experimental results showed that when the data block size was 1GB, the data trusted exchange system based on blockchain technology took 10 seconds, and the data transmission rate still reached 891Mbps.",

Therefore, supply chain management becomes particularly important. Strengthening supply chain management has become a general trend. The traditional cost-oriented supply chain management model has been unable to meet the requirements of modern enterprise development. Given that the changes in customer demand, production, and sales have not been considered, enterprise resources are easily wasted. How to build a new supply chain model driven by value and customer demand has become one of the problems that large enterprises must solve. The combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology (BT) can realize information sharing, risk sharing, data interaction, and other functions. Through smart contracts, the division of responsibilities among all roles in the supply chain is controlled, which makes the supply chain safer and more efficient. In this paper, the authors designed a new supply chain financial system model that can effectively reduce financial risks, improved the efficiency of capital use, and enhanced the competitiveness of enterprises. The authors compared the traditional supply chain management mode with the management mode under the combination of AI and BT. The supply chain resource and economic security management based on AI and blockchain multichannel technology was more efficient, the system security index was higher, and the internal employee satisfaction of the enterprise also increased by 5.98%.
