Digital Automatic Execution and Verification Mechanism of Property Rights Based on Blockchain and Smart Contracts,"Yetong Wang, Kongduo Xing, Bing Zheng",2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f86776aa3ca1ea53b50bcafecdc69ef5d0bf330d,"Blockchain technology (BT), as another important innovation following cloud computing, big data, mobile Internet and other information technologies, uses distributed node consensus algorithms to verify, store and update data, showing the unique advantages of centralization, distrust, anonymity and data tamper resistance. Smart contracts are based on BT as the underlying support, achieving automatic execution of contracts and providing more efficient and secure solutions for various transactions. This article delves into the digital automatic execution and verification mechanism of property rights based on BT and smart contracts. Through this mechanism, property rights information can be digitized and securely stored on the blockchain, achieving real-time updates and multi-party sharing of information, thereby greatly improving the transparency and traceability of property rights transactions. The application of smart contracts further enhances the automatic execution of transactions, ensuring the automatic triggering of relevant operations when transaction conditions are met, and ensuring the legality and effectiveness of transactions through built-in verification mechanisms. The experimental results indicate that this mechanism not only improves the efficiency of property rights transactions, reduces transaction costs and risks, but also brings revolutionary innovation to the field of property rights transactions.",2024 3rd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Autonomous Robot Systems (AIARS),Semantic Scholar

It can minimize the contract risks, principal-agent dilemmas, and other issues in corporate governance. However, DAOs also face a variety of governance issues, such as internal governance issues and external governance issues caused by the technical attributes of blockchain and smart contracts. DAO is a typical complex system with the characteristics of both social and engineering complexity. It is difficult for existing governance theories to solve governance problems in DAOs. The parallel intelligence theory based on the artificial systems + computational experiments + parallel execution (ACP) method is a suitable research and practical approach to solve management and control problems for complex systems. Therefore, we propose a parallel governance framework for DAO based on the parallel intelligence theory and discuss its key research issues. Finally, we construct a parallel governance system for GnosisDAO, and conduct computational experiments on its voting mechanism. The results show the defects of GnosisDAO governance mechanism and we thus propose further research directions. We consider that parallel governance represents the future trend of DAO research and practice.

The growing demand and expansion of blockchain‐IoT systems is generating large volume of sensitive data. Moreover, distributed denial‐of‐service (DDoS) attacks are the most challenging threats to smart contracts in blockchain‐IoT systems. The 2016 decentralized autonomous organization and 2017 parity wallet attacks exposed the critical fault‐lines among Ethereum smart contracts. Currently, there is no security mechanism available for smart contracts after its deployment in blockchain‐IoT systems. In order to address these challenges, first we use two artificial intelligence techniques, random forest (RF) and XGBoost that gives full autonomy in decision making capabilities in the proposed security framework. Second, for data load balancing and distributed file storage of IoT data, interplanetary file system is suggested. Finally, we are the first to propose a distributed framework based on fog computing to detect DDoS attacks in smart contracts. The performance of the detection system is evaluated using actual IoT dataset, namely, BoT‐IoT. The proposed system is evaluated in terms of accuracy (AC), detection rate (DR), and false alarm rate (FAR).

Review of Artificial Intelligence-Integrated Blockchain for Training Autonomous Vehicles,"Amit Kumar, Neha Sharma",2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9fc57bba2ae8d8f7de192fc16a2a4b75018f9a99,"In the realm of autonomous vehicles, learning is achieved through reinforcement learning. To illustrate, let's consider the task of training a self-driving car to apply the brakes when it approaches a wall. Initially, the car continues to drive until it collides with the wall multiple times. These experiences are then stored in its memory, enabling the car to learn from them. Gradually, through these collisions, the car becomes aware that it must halt when it nears a wall. Traditionally, each car undergoes individual training until it learns to stop automatically and avoid collisions. However, a paradigm shift is proposed in this paper. Instead of isolated learning, each car would be connected to a shared public ledger. This ledger would serve as a platform for cars to exchange their experiences, enabling all vehicles connected to the ledger to learn from a single car's experiences. This collective learning approach eliminates the arduous task of individually training each car. Facilitating this revolutionary concept is the utilization of Blockchain Technology. By leveraging blockchain, cars can collectively enhance their understanding of when to stop, drawing from the valuable experiences shared on the shared ledger. This creates a collaborative ecosystem where knowledge is shared, accelerating the learning process and paving the way for safer and more efficient autonomous vehicles. The integration of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain Technology in the context of autonomous vehicles holds immense promise. Through the implementation of an artificially intelligent blockchain system, the learning process of self-driving cars can be streamlined, fostering a future where shared knowledge propels advancements in technology and enhances overall safety on the roads.

However, integrating IoT and blockchain also has several challenges; for example, major challenge is low throughput. Currently, the ethereum blockchain network can process approximately 12 to 15 transactions per second, while IoT devices require relatively higher throughput. Therefore, blockchains are incapable of providing functionality for a 5G‐enabled IoT based network. The limiting factor of throughput in the blockchain is their network. The slow propagation of transactions and blocks in the P2P network does not allow miners and verifiers to fastly mine and verify new blocks, respectively. Therefore, network scalability is the major issue of IoT based blockchains. In this work, we solved the network scalability issue using blockchain distributed network while to increase the throughput of blockchain, this article uses the Raft consensus algorithm. Another most important issue with IoT networks is privacy. Unfortunately, the blockchain distributed ledgers are public and sensitive information is available on the network for everyone are private, but in such cases, third party editing is not possible without revealing the original contents. To solve privacy issues, we used zkLedger as a solution that is based on zero knowledge‐based cryptography.",Transactions on Emerging Telecommunications Technologies,Semantic Scholar

However, due to security considerations and consistency requirements, smart contracts currently only support simple and deterministic programs, which significantly hinders their deployment in intelligent Web 3.0 applications. To enhance smart contracts intelligence on the blockchain, we propose SMART, a plug-in smart contract framework that supports efficient AI model inference while being compatible with existing blockchains. To handle the high complexity of model inference, we propose an on-chain and off-chain joint execution model, which separates the SMART contract into two parts: the deterministic code still runs inside an on-chain virtual machine, while the complex model inference is offloaded to off-chain compute nodes. To solve the non-determinism brought by model inference, we leverage Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to endorse the integrity and correctness of the off-chain execution. We also design distributed attestation and secret key provisioning schemes to further enhance the system security and model privacy. We implement a SMART prototype and evaluate it on a popular Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based blockchain.

Specific issues arise, such as sharing health Records across institutes or hospitals, problems with misuse of data once shared, no security, etc. The Electronic Health Record (EHR) Framework on Blockchain addresses those issues, resulting from a collaboration of all stakeholders involved. This paper explores the likelihood of representing medical records to make sure data privacy, data accessibility, and data interoperability for the healthcare-specific scenario. Data privacy refers to affording protection to ensure data is available when needed and not used, imparted, accessed, altered, or deleted while being stored or retrieved, or transmitted. Data accessibility is the ability to access the data regardless of natural or artificial accidents, hardware, or others. Improving the accessibility of health data in the healthcare sector while ensuring privacy has been identified as a necessary capability that involves every individual and organization. Traditionally, healthcare interoperability has centered on sharing data between business institutions, such as various hospital systems. The emphasis has lately been on patient-driven information sharing, where the exchange of medical information is patient-mediated and patient-driven.

Not-So-Smart Blockchain Contracts and Artificial Responsibility,Adam J. Kolber,2018,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d57fa33ca431c3f3be2400f74014e8f45ae1f8c7,"The first high-profile decentralized autonomous organization formed in 2016. Called “TheDAO,” it used smart contracts on a bitcoin-style blockchain to allow strangers to come together online to vote on and invest in venture capital proposals. Newspapers raved about the $160 million it quickly raised, even though it purported to have no central human authority, including no managers, executives, or board of directors. 
Technologists have grand plans for smart contracts and autonomous organizations. Rather than staying at traditional hotels with elaborate human staff, we may pay for hotel rooms using bitcoin (or another cryptocurrency) which will automatically unlock the room door. If the toilet breaks, the room itself will contract with a plumber to fix it. Similarly, a smart contract may allow us to hire a self-driving car. The car will not only drive passengers around but arrange for its own routine maintenance. 
TheDAO itself, however, is now a cautionary tale. A bug in its smart contract code was exploited to drain more than $50 million in value. Some purists denounced efforts to mitigate the problem, arguing that the alleged hacker simply withdrew money in accordance with the organization’s agreed-upon contractual terms in the form of computer code. Since the “code is the contract” in their minds, the alleged hacker did nothing wrong. 
I defend two related claims. First, contra the purists, I argue that the code does not reflect the entirety of the parties’ agreement, and so the “code is the contract” slogan does not resolve whether TheDAO exploitation should have been mitigated. I take no position on whether mitigation was appropriate except to say that the matter depends on many considerations aside from smart contract code itself. 
Second, I point to a broader danger lurking in the code-is-the-contract view. TheDAO had tremendous “artificial responsibility” in that we gave it considerable control that couldn’t be easily revoked or reined in. Not-so-smart contracts in the future may prove even more dangerous: hotel guests might be locked out of their rooms, and self-driving cars might drive off bridges. I argue that unadulterated commitment to the code-is-the-contract slogan increases artificial responsibility and its associated risks.",,Semantic Scholar

Using Blockchain for Decentralized Artificial Intelligence with Data Privacy,"A. Masurkar, Xiaoyan Sun, Jun Dai",2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8e6a80d00703a980c6f54574faa10818f6abc6f9,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions require model training, which traditionally needs local datasets to be uploaded to a centralized server. However, centralized learning usually creates issues in terms of data privacy, data control, and data security. To address these issues, decentralized AI, especially federated learning, is proposed to achieve no data sharing or data exchange across servers and decentralized devices. This paper proposes a new decentralized AI paradigm based on blockchain, which goes beyond the decentralized federated learning to require no model pooling or orchestrating on any central server. That is, we propose further decentralization by dismissing the central or-chestrator in federated learning through the usage of blockchain (e.g., Ethereum in this paper), which is inherently a decentralized, distributed, peer-to-peer and autonomous mechanism. We implemented a prototype to demonstrate the idea, in which models are trained on data contributors’ ends. Instead of moving models to a central place for combining (such as in federated learning), models are trained independently on data contributors’ sides, and flow to the decentralized blockchain for updating. In this process, smart contracts on Ethereum provide specifications required for model creation. In addition, data contributors are rewarded Ether coins for their contributions to train the model with their data. This also incentivizes data contributors to provide data for AI training while protecting their data privacy.","International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications",Semantic Scholar
Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI) integration for revolutionizing security and transparency in finance,"N. Rane, Saurabh P. Choudhary, Jayesh Rane",2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/46c84facf5f9e15f6fe9c7f4d0eac9389c9a891d,": The convergence of Blockchain technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is exerting a transformative influence, ushering in a new epoch of security and transparency within the financial sector. This amalgamation effectively addresses pivotal challenges faced by conventional financial systems, presenting inventive solutions to heighten efficiency, diminish fraud, and amplify transparency. Blockchain, functioning as a decentralized and tamper-resistant ledger, introduces a paradigm shift in financial transactions. Its capacity to establish an unalterable record of transactions ensures that once data is recorded, it remains impervious to modification, thereby furnishing an unparalleled level of security. This inherent security attribute positions Blockchain as an optimal choice for reinforcing financial systems against cyber threats and fraudulent activities. On the other hand, AI contributes predictive analytics, machine learning, and automation to the forefront of financial operations. The integration of AI in finance enables real-time data analysis, risk assessment, and decision-making, optimizing processes and elevating overall efficiency. When amalgamated with Blockchain, AI augments the precision and dependability of financial data, cultivating a more secure and transparent ecosystem. A pivotal aspect of this integration in finance is the streamlining of Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) processes. The decentralized nature of Blockchain facilitates secure storage of customer data, mitigating the risk of identity theft, while AI algorithms adeptly analyze extensive datasets to pinpoint and flag suspicious activities. This not only augments security but also ensures adherence to regulatory requirements. Smart contracts, a distinctive feature of Blockchain, automate and enforce contractual agreements, diminishing the reliance on intermediaries and minimizing the probability of human error. AI algorithms can be seamlessly integrated into these contracts to enhance their adaptability and responsiveness to evolving market conditions, further refining financial processes. The transparency ushered in by Blockchain ensures that all stakeholders have access to a singular version of the truth, fostering trust in financial transactions. Furthermore, the incorporation of AI in fraud detection and risk management heightens the proactive identification of potential threats, safeguarding financial institutions and their clientele. As financial institutions increasingly embrace this integration, the industry stands on the brink of a revolution that not only safeguards against existing challenges but also paves the way for innovative and efficient financial ecosystems.",Social Science Research Network,Semantic Scholar

This paper proposes a novel design framework that uses Federated learning-Artificial intelligence (FAI) for decision-making and Smart Contract (SC) policies for process execution and control in a completely automated smart automobile manufacturing industry. The proposed design introduces a novel element called Trust Threshold Limit (TTL) that helps moderate the excess usage of embedded equipment, tools, energy, and cost functions, limiting wastages in the manufacturing processes. This research highlights the use cases of AI in decentralised Blockchain with smart contracts, the company’s trading policies, and its advantages for effectively handling market risk assessments during socio-economic crisis. The developed model supported by real-time cases incorporated cost functions, delivery time and energy evaluations. Results spotlight the use of FAI in decision accuracy for the developed smart contract-based Automobile Assembly Model (AAM), thereby qualitatively limiting the threshold level of cost, energy and other control functions in procurement assembly and manufacturing.
